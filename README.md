This was part of my application to Tagesspiegel Innovation Lab for the GNI Student Fellowship 2023 hosted by the European Journalism Centre.
The following task was part of the third round sent out to all participating applicants and set to be solved within 4 days:

> 1. Please choose a topic from the fields of traffic, urban planning, climate change, land use or housing in Europe.
> 2. Research data on that topic and provide a) a clear working title, b) a hypothesis what you can answer about that topic by the help of the data, c) a reason why this is relevant for a larger journalistic audience.
> 3. Then give some main findings you saw in that data in the form of bullet points. You can also include graphs or any other form of visualization to prove a point you would want to make. Your preliminary results can either be heavily focused on data analysis, data visualization, illustration or text-based reasoning on the basis of the data you found.
> 4. What would you do next about the article? Which are open questions you'd continue working on? Is there further research you'd want to do based on your initial research? Or do you have nice visual ideas that you'd like to develop based on your initial findings?

The results of my work are found in [complete.html](gh_pages/complete.html), which is also hosted [here](https://docweirdo.de/public_playgrounds_berlin/complete.html) for convenience. I unfortunately did not make it past the final round.
