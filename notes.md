# Limitations
## Playgrounds
- some playgrounds do not seem to be in the cities registry
- parks are not included in the analysis and might be better than a playground
- not all playgrounds had effective playarea

## LOR
- borders arbitrary, playgrounds within as well
    - mitigation by calculating adjunctness

## children
